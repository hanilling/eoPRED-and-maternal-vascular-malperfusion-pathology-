# eoPRED and maternal vascular malperfusion pathology 
This respository contains code from the paper “A placental DNA methylation score associated with early-onset preeclampsia and maternal vascular malperfusion pathology”. It involves testing for an association between eoPRED score and placental histopathology.

The Stress Pregnancy and Health (SPAH) dataset was used. It is available at GSE307289. Additional pathology information is available upon request to the authors. Code pertaining to the initial processing of this dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/hanilling/DNA_methylation_profiling_of_placental_histopathology-).

The function to calculate eoPRED score is available in the [PlaNET R package](https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.planet).
